- Software 1.0: Traditional algorithmic programmic
- Software 2.0: Bunch of parameters that we don't have much visibility. Supervised/unsupervised/reinforcement learning
    - Inputs and outputs are always just numbers. We may see a "photograph" of Lincoln. But machine sees a matrix and outputs another number, a vector that defines Lincoln.
    - Why is it hard? 
        - Infinite variety of inputs can all mean the same thing. I love this movie. vs This movie is amazing.
        - Meaningful differences can be tiny. 
        - Structure of the world is complex. 
    - Dominant approach nowadays is neural nets (deep learning)
