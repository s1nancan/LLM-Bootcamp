To be honest, the video is a quick review of what the each part is about, but realistically, one need to deep dive into the project to understand what happens in each segment. Also, to be honest, these type of work/project are cool data science projects but at this point, given the tooling and api calls and all that, it is mostly engineering, where you need to learn to make deployments, etc. So this is more of an LLMOps type of work, than pure research/business focused data science work. 

Hence, I am not going to put specific notes about this part of the project, but I will make a mental note of going back to this repo and reviewing each segment and maybe try to replicate it for some other context as an end to end project.
